// itself throws, which skips every middleware after it, injectViewLocals
// included. Without this, the 500/404 templates crash on their own
// (head.ejs reading `canonicalUrl`/`business`/`env`/etc., none of which
// were ever set) instead of showing the friendly error page — turning a
// single failure into a raw, unstyled crash on every request. Calling it
// directly (not as registered middleware) is safe here: it's synchronous,
// does no DB work, and already treats a missing req.session as optional.
