// Route landing pages — "Bangalore to X" outstation route guides. Static
// data: distance/travel-time are well-established public road-distance
// facts (approximate, since actual figures vary by exact pickup point and
// route taken), never fabricated. No fares are published here — only the
// existing confirmed per-km rates already shown on vehicle pages.

// vehicleSlugs below must use the CURRENT DB slug — vehicles.ts's "Popular
// Routes" block on a vehicle's own page does a plain `v.slug === vehicle.slug`
// match against these entries (not alias-aware), so a stale slug here makes
// that section silently render empty for real routes that do feature the
// vehicle, rather than erroring. (Found live: all 10 entries below still said
// "9-seater-tempo-traveller" after the vehicle's DB slug moved to
// "tempo-traveller-12-seater" — fixed below.)
